*The Snake Game*

A simple version of snake games we've seen in old phones before

Things that you have to do to launh the project correctly:

        -Install Javafx from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/

        -Add libraries in the "lib" folder as Referenced Libraries to your project

        -Create the "launch.json" and add "vmArgs": "--module-path \"path\to\lib\folder" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml" line to TheGame.java

The snake consists of squares and the head has a arrow which looks at the front always

You fail if you eat yourself or hit walls
